# Cryptocurrency Explorer Chrome Extension

A Google Chrome extension which displays information about a cryptocurrency in a popup when the user selects a coin ticker (BTC/ ETH/ XYZ) and presses (mac)CTRL+SHIFT+L. It's also possible to use the search feature, check the top searched coins of CoinGecko in the last 24 hours or compare market caps of different tokens; What would the price of coin x be with the market cap of coin Y.

### To do's/ Ideas

- Style graph y-axis, done
- Don't close extension after link click, done
- Ready to type on search bar the token you are looking for, done
- Top Trending coins CoinGecko; idea grey out, burn if clicked, done
- Show clickable , done
- Display price at certain marketcap; if x has same MC a y then x price is z, done
- More smooth chart transition, done
- Another little addition could be have a # next to the market cap rank; WOO #166, done

- When you search for a new coin, I think the dropdown with the coin name should be highlighted so its more obvious to click; pointer change implemented

* USD chart \$BTRFLY out of range
